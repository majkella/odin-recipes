        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my favourite pumpkin soup for the cold Autumn days. The soup is refreshing thanks to the oranges, ginger, on the other hand, will warm up even the coldest person.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g pumpkin (weight with skin)</li>
            <li>1tbsp butter + 1/2tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2tsp freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>pinch of ginger powder</li>
            <li>1/3 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>vegetable bouillon</li>
            <li>50 - 125g Philadelphia cheese (or 80ml cream cheese)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4tbsp of flaked almonds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the pumpkin, remove the seeds, peel and cut into cubes. In a pot melt butter with oil, add ginger and gently fry for about half a minute.</li>
            <li>Add the pumpkin, a pinch of salt and fry while stirring for about 3 minutes. Add the ginger powder, pour in the orange juice and enough stock to cover the pumpkin. Cook covered until soft, about half an hour.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese or cream and pour into the blender container. Blend to a smooth cream. Check after blending to see if you need to season with salt.
            </li>
            <li>Brown flaked almonds in a dry frying pan. Add to the soup. </li>
        </ol>
