        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious and simple to make apple pie on shortcrust pastry. Everyone can make it and everyone likes it! For extra crispiness you can replace some of the butter with lard (the secret ingredient of grandma's apple pie recipes ;-)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5kg apples (preferably firm and sour)</li>
                <li>5tbsp sugar</li>
                <li>1/2tsp cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Pie</li>
            <ul>
                <li>300g flour</li>
                <li>250g cold butter (50g butter may be replaced by lard)</li>
                <li>1.5tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>5tbsp sugar</li>
                <li>1tbsp vanilla sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>For sprinkling: caster sugar</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the apples, cut into quarters and remove the core. Cut into smaller pieces and place in a wide pot or deep frying pan.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and cinnamon and cook for approx. 20 minutes, stirring every now and then, until the apples are soft and starting to break down.</li>
            <li>Add the diced cold butter, baking powder, sugar and vanilla sugar to the flour.</li>
            <li>Combine the ingredients into a smooth dough (with a mixer or by hand), add the egg at the end (the dough will be quite soft).</li>
            <li>Divide it in half and put both halves in the freezer for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Prepare a small baking tin.</li>
            <li>Remove one half of the pastry from the freezer, cut into slices with a knife and line the bottom of the tin with them. Then place the apples on top.</li>
            <li>Grate the remaining pastry directly onto the apples (or cut the pastry into slices and place on top).</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and bake for approximately 50 minutes or until golden brown. Let the baked apple pie cool down and sprinkle with icing sugar.</li>
        </ol>
