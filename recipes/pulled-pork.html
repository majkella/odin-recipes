        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pulled pork is pork shoulder roasted for a long time at low temperature (or slow cooked in the slow cooker). At the end, the meat becomes so soft that it falls apart under the pressure of a fork and tears into thin fibres.</p>
        <p>Pulled pork is the main ingredient in a pulled pork sandwich.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the onion and cut into thicker slices, peel the garlic and crush with a knife. Place onions and garlic in the bottom of a casserole dish (or slow cooker). Pour in the apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Rinse meat with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Trim off large pieces of fat, if any (leave small pieces). Brush the meat with olive oil and rub it with the spice mixture. Put it into the pot (lay it on top of the onion and garlic).</li>
            <li>Cover and bake: in the oven for 9 hours at 90 degrees C, in the slow cooker for 7 hours (high setting) or 9 hours (low setting).</li>
            <li>Once the meat has been removed, separate it with two forks into thin filaments, you can add the onion pieces from the roast and a few spoonfuls of the sauce from the roast (ignoring the fat collected on top). The bbq sauce added to the meat at the end and stirred in is also great (amount given x4).</li>
